                <p>Hello, I'm Tuan Cai, a 4th-year Computer Science major at Georgia Tech. One thing I'm incredibly passionate about is
                contributing to social good, and one of the ways I've done that is through my involvement with MedShare. It's been an
                inspiring journey working with MedShare, where I've had the opportunity to make a positive impact on healthcare by
                helping to provide medical supplies and equipment to underserved communities. It's fulfilling to see how technology and
                innovation can be harnessed for the betterment of society, and I'm excited to continue this mission as I progress in my
                studies and career in computer science at Georgia Tech.</p>
